        <h3>Who I am</h3>  
        <p><i>"I am a graduate major in Computer Information Technology. My work experience has been mainly focusing on IT system in healthcare, Relational Database, IT Risk. I also have a strong background in Finance and the ability to "work independently in the office and remotely during the COVID- 19 pandemic" - said by my manager at PHSA."</i></p>
     
        <h3>Why did I switch from Finance to IT</h3>  
        <p>Before coming into BCIT, I had a bachelor in Finance and Banking. For me, it is more an addition to my knowledge than a switch. To be more specific, during my time at the university, I have been engaged in several researches carried out by the School of Business. With the support of my advisor and the university alumni, I had the opportunity to approach local companies, saw their transformation in Information Technology to improve their business. Fascinated by how IT is applied to improve business performance, I discovered my strong passion in technologies and innovations. </p>

<p>Since I had a background in finance and banking, I was expected to work in the same major I had graduated from but I chose a slightly different option to working in an IT project. It was a project to develop a new core-banking system for a commercial bank in Vietnam. The company I was with at the time was CMC SI Saigon. 

My main duties in the project was to support the bank delivering their requirements to Infosys (the company provides the new core-banking solutions to the bank). It was clear to see the demand of the bank to have updated information at their fingertips for quick accurate decision-making. The banksâ€™ reasoning was that they need precise and real-time insight into everything to win in the market.</p>
          <p> It was an invaluable time for a new graduate and an eye-opening experience for anyone who just started their career in the IT industry.</p>

<!--        <p>I like to cook Asian dishes especially Thailand and Vietnam. My favorite weekend's activity is hiking. I really enjoy the woody scents in the air during the hike and I also learn that healthy mind lives in healthy body. </p>-->
<!--        <p>I came from a non-English speaking country. There are always less resources available in any other languages than in English. I always wanted to build non-profit English schools for children in remote areas in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. That will be my goal in the next 7 years. Therefore, everyday I wake up, I am telling myself "believe in yourself and you're halfway there".</p>-->
